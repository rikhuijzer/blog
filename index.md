I'm a PhD student.
This site contains blog posts, since writing has [many benefits](/posts/blog-benefits).
This site is generated with the Julia programming language and the code is [open source](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/franklin-blog).
For more information about this site or me, see [about](/about).
