## This website

This website is built with [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) and the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
Most posts on this site contain math, plots and the code to reproduce the results.
Adding the code makes reading the posts more difficult.
However, I think it is a necessity when doing statistics since statistical calculations usually take ages to do manualy.
For example, fitting a simple linear model requires minimizing the sum of squares.
