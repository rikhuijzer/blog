In this post, I&#39;ll present an adapted version. In line with the rest of this blog, I&#39;ll give an example of selling a programming language which is not <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub</a> to a company, the newer language is called Y. Assume that the company is fine with language Blub because, well, everything is written in Blub and all the employees know Blub.</p> <h2 id=name_a_big_and_relevant_change_in_the_world ><a href="#name_a_big_and_relevant_change_in_the_world" class=header-anchor ><ol> <li><p>Name a big and relevant change in the world</p> </ol> </a></h2> <p>Not moving saves energy and is what you and I like to do. To get the listener moving, show that the world around them is changing. For example:</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Big data analysis is embedded in more and more companies and even nations.</em></p> </ul> <h2 id=ol_start2_show_that_there_will_be_losers_and_winners ><a href="#ol_start2_show_that_there_will_be_losers_and_winners" class=header-anchor ><ol start=2 > <li><p>Show that there will be losers and winners</p> </ol> </a></h2> <p>Next, show that this change in the world is affecting their world:</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Companies which do not use big data are not as efficient as companies who do. Customers switch to competitors because the competitors can help them better and faster.</em></p> <li><p><em>Amazon has switched from selling books to being the biggest cloud provider in the world.</em></p> </ul> <h2 id=ol_start3_tease_the_promised_land ><a href="#ol_start3_tease_the_promised_land" class=header-anchor ><ol start=3 > <li><p>Tease the promised land</p> </ol> </a></h2> <p>Transition from the big picture to the thing you&#39;re selling. Don&#39;t move to fast, or you lose the audience.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Customers see the results of automated analyses this helps them in their daily life.</em></p> </ul> <h2 id=ol_start4_introduce_features_as_magic_gifts_for_overcoming_obstacles_to_the_promised_land ><a href="#ol_start4_introduce_features_as_magic_gifts_for_overcoming_obstacles_to_the_promised_land" class=header-anchor ><ol start=4 > <li><p>Introduce features as &quot;magic gifts&quot; for overcoming obstacles to the promised land</p> </ol> </a></h2> <p>The big solution has been presented, but now the listener wants to know how to do that difficult thing. Luckily, you are there with the solution already:</p> <ul> <li><p><em>With language Y, software developers are more productive than ever and language Y is very suitable for doing analyses.</em></p> </ul> <h2 id=ol_start5_present_evidence_that_you_can_make_the_story_come_true ><a href="#ol_start5_present_evidence_that_you_can_make_the_story_come_true" class=header-anchor ><ol start=5 > <li><p>Present evidence that you can make the story come true</p> </ol> </a></h2> <p>Listeners are now likely to be skeptical about whether you can actually solve that big problem that was introduced before. Therefore, show evidence that you can really solve the problem.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Together with company Foo, we have put three big data systems into production in as little as one year.</em></p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Rik Huijzer.
