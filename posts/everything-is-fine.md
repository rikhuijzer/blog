The news is full of headlines such as
"Why The Global Economy is Recovering Faster Than Expected"
(Harvard Business Review, October [2020](https://hbr.org/2020/11/why-the-global-economy-is-recovering-faster-than-expected)).
and "Dutch Economy Grows Again, Second Corona Low is Over"
(NOS, August [2021](https://nos.nl/artikel/2394161-nederlandse-economie-groeit-weer-tweede-coronadip-voorbij) _(in Dutch)_)
It completely baffles me how these articles overlook a simple explanation from Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger:
we are in a massive speculative bubble.

To see why this is the case, let's look at the long-term stock price of Microsoft.

So, aha.
Okay.
Well, that can happen you could say.
Investors apparently think that Microsoft is doing very well and I agree.
But, are they doing **this** well?
Let's go to a completely different brand that is not related to software.
The brand that most of us love and know, namely WD-40.

Both these images show that the crises of 2000 and 2007 have affected the stock price, but that we're now seeing something **completely different**.
If you think that I've cherry picked these companies, just look at the NASDAQ Composite index.

\figure{/assets/everything-is-fine/nasdaq.jpg}{NASDAQ composite price}{Price of the NASDAQ Composite}{https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^IXIC}{Yahoo}

Okay, so now you're thinking that it's probably only the NASDAQ.
This is the AEX index (Amsterdam):

Or, the Jakarta Composite index (Indonesia):

Or, Bitcoin:

Or, houses:

\figure{/assets/everything-is-fine/houses.jpg}{House price}{House price index}{https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/03/09/global-house-prices}{Economist}

Okay, so everything has increased in price.
But why is that bad?
To see that, let's read something about bubbles.
For example, the [Japanese asset price bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble) of the late 1990s.

> The Japanese asset price bubble (バブル景気, baburu keiki, "bubble economy") was an economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991 in which real estate and stock market prices were greatly inflated. [...]
> More specifically, over-confidence and speculation regarding asset and stock prices were closely associated with excessive monetary easing policy at the time.
> [...]
> Even though asset prices had visibly collapsed by early 1992, the economy's decline continued for more than a decade.

The starts sounds exactly like the current situation.
Governments are printing lots of money, that is, an _excessive monetary easing policy_ comparable to the policy used to **recover** from the financial crisis of 2007.
Note that in the figures above, we haven't had any crisis yet.

\figure{/assets/everything-is-fine/fed.jpg}{Money supply}{Federal Reserve buyback of US debt}{https://returnontime.com/quantitative-easing-2008-vs-2020/}{Return on Time}

Another example is the [Wall Street Crash of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929).

> The "Roaring Twenties", the decade following World War I that led to the crash, was a time of wealth and excess.
> [...]
> Despite the inherent risk of speculation, it was widely believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever
> [...]
> The crash, which followed the London Stock Exchange's crash of September, signaled the beginning of the Great Depression.

Although this sounds abstract, great depressions are just bad.
People lose their income, which results in a lot of suffering.

So, **are we going into a new great depression?**
Nobody knows.
I can only end with some timeless ideas from Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet.
They have said on multiple occasions that they cannot predict when a market crash will occur.
They only know when prices are too high and if that they just sit on their hands and wait for the next crash.
This might take months to years, they have [patience](https://summarycollection.com/tao-of-charlie-munger/).
This quote from Buffet in 2013 seems like a nice one to end with:

> [The Fed] is under no pressure, none whatsoever to have to deleverage.
> So it can pick it's time, and if you have somebody wise there [...] it can be handled.
> But it is something that's never quite been done on this scale. It will be interesting to watch.
