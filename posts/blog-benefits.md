The first step into creating good habits is figuring out why exactly you want the habit.
To me, writing blog posts seems like a good habit, but I'm unsure why.
This post will attempt to convince the reader and myself of the benefits.
I have combined my own ideas with the ideas by Terry Tao [[1]](#1) and Gregory Gunderson [[2]](#2), and grouped them.

### Pedagogic benefits

- Writing detailed expository notes is a way to practise research.
  This allows you to break free from the methods you are used to [[2]](#2).
- One can practise writing [[1]](#1).
- Writing allows one to test understanding of an idea [[1]](#1).
  It forces you to explain it clearly without hand waving.
  When aiming your text at colleagues or future employers, you cannot use jargon to hide your lack of knowledge [[2]](#2).
- Writing allows figuring out what exactly you do not understand or what you need to learn first [[2]](#2).
- Writing aids in structuring knowledge [[2]](#2).

### Practical benefits

- Writing a post might not actually solve some difficult problem, but it is a concrete step towards a solution [[2]](#2).
  It will probably teach you a lot about the background of a problem.
- Good ideas do not randomly appear. They are formed after getting a deep understanding of the problem [[2]](#2).
- Information can be recalled easily [[1, 2]](#2).
- Writing frees up mental space [[1]](#1).

### Collaborative benefits

- It eases sharing information with friends and colleagues.
- Much (scientific) knowledge, which someone in this world has, is not known to the public.
  Writing technical blogs can help to spread information [[2]](#2).
- Others can inform you of mistakes in your thoughts.
  See the post by Swartz [[3]](#3) for more about better thinking.
- Compared to papers, blogs are read by more people.

By now, I hope the reader is convinced.
I have, at least, convinced myself.
